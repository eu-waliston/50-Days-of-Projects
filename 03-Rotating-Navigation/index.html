        <h1>What are Web Services?</h1>

        <p>
          The Internet is the worldwide connectivity of hundreds of thousands of
          computers of various types that belong to multiple networks. On the
          World Wide Web, a web service is a standardized method for propagating
          messages between client and server applications. A web service is a
          software module that is intended to carry out a specific set of
          functions. Web services in cloud computing can be found and invoked
          over the network. The web service would be able to deliver
          functionality to the client that invoked the web service. A web
          service is a set of open protocols and standards that allow data to be
          exchanged between different applications or systems. Web services can
          be used by software programs written in a variety of programming
          languages and running on a variety of platforms to exchange data via
          computer networks such as the Internet in a similar way to
          inter-process communication on a single computer. Any software,
          application, or cloud technology that uses standardized web protocols
          (HTTP or HTTPS) to connect, interoperate, and exchange data messages –
          commonly XML (Extensible Markup Language) – across the internet is
          considered a web service. Web services have the advantage of allowing
          programs developed in different languages to connect with one another
          by exchanging data over a web service between clients and servers. A
          client invokes a web service by submitting an XML request, which the
          service responds with an XML response.

        <p>
          XML and HTTP is the most fundamental web services platform. The
          following components are used by all typical web services: SOAP
          (Simple Object Access Protocol) SOAP stands for “Simple Object Access
          Protocol.” It is a transport-independent messaging protocol. SOAP is
          built on sending XML data in the form of SOAP Messages. A document
          known as an XML document is attached to each message. Only the
          structure of the XML document, not the content, follows a pattern. The
          best thing about Web services and SOAP is that everything is sent
          through HTTP, the standard web protocol. A root element known as the
          element is required in every SOAP document. In an XML document, the
          root element is the first element. The “envelope” is separated into
          two halves. The header comes first, followed by the body. The routing
          data, or information that directs the XML document to which client it
          should be sent to, is contained in the header. The real message will
          be in the body. UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and
          Integration) UDDI is a standard for specifying, publishing and
          discovering a service provider’s online services. It provides a
          specification that aids in the hosting of data via web services. UDDI
          provides a repository where WSDL files can be hosted so that a client
          application can discover a WSDL file to learn about the various
          actions that a web service offers. As a result, the client application
          will have full access to the UDDI, which serves as a database for all
          WSDL files. The UDDI registry will hold the required information for
          the online service, just like a telephone directory has the name,
          address, and phone number of a certain individual. So that a client
          application may figure out where it is. WSDL (Web Services Description
          Language) If a web service can’t be found, it can’t be used. The
          client invoking the web service should be aware of the location of the
          web service. Second, the client application must understand what the
          web service does in order to invoke the correct web service. The WSDL,
          or Web services description language, is used to accomplish this. The
          WSDL file is another XML-based file that explains what the web service
          does to the client application. The client application will be able to
          understand where the web service is located and how to use it by using
          the WSDL document.
